🌱 Smart Farming Using Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
An AI-driven approach to optimize fertilizer recommendations using NPK values.


🚀 Overview
This project utilizes Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) to analyze NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) values and recommend the optimal fertilizer for crops. By leveraging machine learning, this system helps farmers make data-driven decisions, improving crop yield and soil health.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
Machine Learning (Feedforward Neural Network)
Jupyter Notebook (for training and analysis)
Flask/FastAPI (if you have a web-based interface)
📌 Features
✅ NPK-Based Fertilizer Recommendation – Predicts the best fertilizer based on soil NPK levels.
✅ Machine Learning Model – Uses a trained FNN model for prediction.
✅ Data Preprocessing – Cleans and normalizes NPK input data for better accuracy.
✅ Web Interface (Optional) – Can be integrated into a web app for user interaction.

📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of:

Nitrogen (N)
Phosphorus (P)
Potassium (K)
Recommended Fertilizer (used as the label for training)
🧠 Model Training
The FNN model is trained using:

Input: NPK values
Hidden Layers: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation
Output: Recommended fertilizer category
Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
📈 Results & Performance
Achieved XX% accuracy on test data.
Helps in reducing overuse of fertilizers and improving soil health.
🎯 Future Enhancements
Include additional soil parameters (pH, moisture, temperature).
Integrate a web-based UI for easy access.
Deploy as an API for real-time predictions.
